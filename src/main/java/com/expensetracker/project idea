Project Purpose: Expense & Budget Analyzer

Goal:

Track all expenses of a user and store them in a database

Analyze spending patterns

Provide insights like total spent, spending by category, and trends over time

Core Features / Roles:

Add Expenses

User provides: item name, amount, category, date

Each expense is stored in the database

View Expenses

List all stored expenses

Optionally filter by date, category, or amount

Analyze / Calculate

Total expenses (overall)

Total expenses by category

Daily, weekly, or monthly totals (optional)

Delete / Update Expenses (Optional for basic project)

User can remove or correct an expense

Logical Flow of the Project

Collect Data

Input: item name, amount, category, date

Can come from Java objects first (for testing) or HTML form later

Store Data

Use JDBC to insert the data into MySQL table (expenses)

id auto-generates, so each row is unique

Retrieve Data

Query database to get expenses for reporting or calculations

Perform Calculations / Analysis

Total spent: SUM all amounts

Category-wise spending: GROUP BY category and SUM(amount)

Optional: trends over time using date comparisons

Display / Output

Could be simple console output in Java

Later, display in web page table

Example Use Case

User buys a coffee ($5), lunch ($10), and a book ($20) in December

The app stores each expense in the database

Then you can calculate:

Total spent in December: $35

Food category total: $15

Books category total: $20

Summary

The point of the project is not just CRUD (insert, update, delete), but also analyzing the data to understand spending

Calculations like total spent, category totals, and monthly summaries are the “value-added” part
